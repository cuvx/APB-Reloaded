`DISCLAIMER`

**I take 0 responsibility for any damage done to your game or your account. Installing these configs are always at your own risk!
Some of the files shared may (officially) be against the Terms of Service (ToS).**


# üîÑ Installation
Start by creating a new shortcut so the game won't launch through the `APB Launcher`.
```
Launching the game through "the APB Launcher"
will cause the game to replace your newly installed config files.
```
You can create a new shortcut by going to your APB game directory `APB Reloaded\Binaries`, right click the `APB.exe > Create shortcut` and place this where ever you usually start your game from.
```
Your APB folder is usually found at:
- Drive:\Gamersfirst\APB Reloaded\
- Drive:\Steam\steamapps\common\APB Reloaded\
```
After creating your shortcut you have the option to add some of the following `Launch Arguments`
* `-language=1031` Tells your game to start with your installed localization.
* `-nomovies` Removes all loading screens.
* `-nosplash` Removes the splashscreen when starting the game.
* `-nosteam` Removes the connection to Steam.

Now you can start dragging your desired configs in to the `APB Reloaded` directory.
